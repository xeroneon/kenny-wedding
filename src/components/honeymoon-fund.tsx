                    In lieu of a registry for wedding gifts, we have set up a honeymoon fund
                    and contributions towards the honeymoon are welcome! Your presence is
                    the greatest gift, but if you wish to give something, it would be much
                    appreciated!
                </p>

                    We are taking a cruise to Alaska! While Kenny may have lived there, it's
                    been a bucketlist item of Jessica's. We are beyond excited to make our
                    own memories!
