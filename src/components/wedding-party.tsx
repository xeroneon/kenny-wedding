        Wedding Party
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are so excited to celebrate with our closest family and friends! We
        are both blessed to have the best childhood friends that will be making
        up our wedding party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jessica’s Crew:</strong> Jessica has known Dani, Alyssa,
        Brittany, and Kristin since 1994 when they started kindergarten together
        in San Ramon. Taylor came along a bit later, but we count her as an OG
        member, in fact she is the real MVP. This group of girls have been
        through everything you can possibly imagine together and are the true
        definition of BFFs/soulmates. Or as Jessica's mom lovingly calls them,
        littermates. They say friends are the family we choose ourselves and
        these girls are truly Jessica's chosen sisters.

        <strong>Kenny’s Crew:</strong> Kenny has known Will, Matt, Ryan, and
        Travis, since childhood when they made up the LMC (Lush Meadows Crew).
        Jon came along a bit later when he fell in love with Kenny's amazing
        sister, Stephanie. And their officiant, Justin is another close friend
        from childhood that Kenny, in a twist of small world fate, ended up
        serving with in North Carolina. They are truly ride or dies and have
        supported Kenny through it all. We are so thankful to share this amazing
        day with them. Disclaimer: We apologize in advanced for any potential
        speeches, especially coming from Dani or Will.
